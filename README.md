# ðŸš¨ Important notice ðŸš¨

This project is no longer maintained. The good news is that the landscape of payments on React Native has massively changed in the last few years. There is still room for this repo to evolve which I'll detail below, but first I would like to direct your attention to well-funded and well-maintained alternatives that will give you fewer grey hairs.

## Stripe

- Stripe has released an official React Native SDK supporting Apple Pay that has a huge team of paid engineers behind it.
- It has also been included in the [Expo managed environment](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/stripe/), which means it works on Expo Go. Huge achievement.
- For a bug free experience and easy integration I strongly recommend you use [@stripe/stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native) on any new projects.

We also have some legacy example projects in the `examples` directory that will be rewritten soon and linked above.

Bear with us while we organize things a bit.
